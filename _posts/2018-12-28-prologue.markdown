Hello there. I'm starting a blog with the new year. I'm building projects for improving my software and math
skills. Recently it's a ray tracer. I think make blog posts about these projects is a good idea.
Blog posts are really cool because it's a playground for expressing your ideas into the text and
also good English practicing area, especially for non-native English language people.

I used Jekyll and GitHub pages for this page and it's a bit of a pain in the ass.
Far more redundant work from just creating Wordpress page and start writing.
But it is faster for the reader actually. So, I am sticking to it for now.
Let's see where it goes.
